# Project Basecamp

I have been keeping track of the days I've run an when I haven't via a question Basecamp asks me everyday.

The goal of this project is to download the answers to those questions collect them and come up with some insights, while learning Rust along the way!  There are probably better languages to do this in, but if it becomes really apparent, maybe I'll try some FFI.
